* Communication Protocols:

General Communcations: General communications and questions will be done through the Slack app in a group text channel. This will be where quick technical questions and general discussion will take place

Project Mapping and Deliverables: Primary communcation regarding big picture project mapping and segmentation of deliverables into stories to be completed from SCRUM or AGILE Project management discussions will occur in group calls via Slack app voice channel.  Summarization of notes from each session will be posted in .txt or .docx format in the Slack app group text channel. These files should be eventually uploaded into Documentation foler in main branch

Commits and Code Peer Review: All collaborators will be able to create pull requests or accept pull requests. All collaborators will be able to commit their own code, and peer review other code before merging with main branch. Main branch edits can be performed by anyone invited as a collaborator until the project is public. Repository cannot go public until final review by the data provider or anyone employed by the data provider. Code review comments can be sent through general communications protocol as .txt or .docx, but should eventually be uploaded into Documentation/Internal Code Review folder in main branch.  Polished code documentation and methodology will be uploaded to README.md.

Other Communications: Other communications such as communications with the data provider or with instructors will be conducted through whichever communication platform requested by the other party. Here other party is defined as anyone who is not a repository collaborator.
