## Selected Topic: the Streaming Video Industry

According to PwC's latest Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2022, the streaming video industry was valued at $79.1 billion in revenues worldwide and will continue to grow at a pace of 7-10% annually for the next few years. The big driver of opportunity will be a major shift by all major players in the subscription video space (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock) to hybrid streaming models that combine lower-priced, ad-supported tiers with more premium, ad-free tiers.

Across the streaming video industry, content providers and distributors are moving into big data to analyze subscriber funnels and viewership patterns to optimize content production/acquisition costs, help with programming decisions, improve content recommendation to their users and ultimately drive subscriber and advertising revenue.

## Our Client

Our real-world client is an online distributor of online video based in Western Europe and specialized in music content, mostly full-length concerts and documentaries. They offer 3 advertising-backed, linear channels (free/no subscription), a premium subscription service and a large library of titles available for sale to other conventional channels.

The data has been anonymized to preserve the confidentiality of the client.

## Client's and Project's Objectives

Our study will focus on viewership data pertaining to the 3 linear channels

## Data
- 550 CSV files containing viewership data for 3 channels across 14 operators in 67 countries from 18Feb21 to 6Nov22
- 1 CSV file containing advertising revenue for their 3 channels across 19 main territories from 28Feb22 to 25Oct22
- Programming details, IDs, genres, tags
- Channels mapping
- Operators mapping
- Countries mapping

## Methodology / Steps / Decisions made while cleaning
- Merge all 550 viewership files into one
- Anonymize the data pertaining to channel and operator names
